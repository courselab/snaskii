# Contributing to this project

This document needs to be properly edited.

## Meanwhile, these are some essencial notes

This project's development workflow is based on 

- GitFlow branching strategy [1]
- Semantiv versionng 2.0.0 release naming scheme [2]

If you obtain the source from the Version Control Repository [3], you will
need GNU Build System (aka Autotools) to build the project (note 1)

Latest stabe release resides in _main_ branch.
Pre-release (alpha, beta, release candidates) reside on branch _prerelease_.

Contribution admission policy requires developers to proposed modifications
as feature branches and submitted them as pull requests, which in turn
need to be approved by other developers before being merged into the propper 
branches.

If you are developer and is assinged an issue, and you believe you are not
able to handle timely, please, try to reasign it to someone else.

Code wisdom for this project

- Branch always (create a new feature branch for each modification)
- Commit small (add & commit single changes for better traceability)
- Merge safe (test, discuss and approve merges to permanent branches)

Notes

(1) A distribution repository with tarballs with pre-build configuration
scripts (does not need Autotools) should be available upon the first
stable release.
